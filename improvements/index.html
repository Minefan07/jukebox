				#0004: Fixed the slight visual cutoff on the audio display on the right side<br>

				#0006: It is no longer possible to make the Jukebox go ludicrous by spamming "MC Ambience"<br>
				#0007: Renamed button from "Playable Song List" to "Playable Song Table" to better reflect where it leads<br>
				#0008: Fixed the immense bias to random song selection when a single song is inputted and the "MC Ambience" button is pressed
